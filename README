This project is designed to address the issue of meaningless BT traffic being pulled to reduce downstream traffic by Chinaâ€™s PCDN. At the same time, it cannot simply set a global sharing ratio limit because it requires specific tagged seeds to continue seeding. As you can see, I have hardcoded the tags into the code, so this is not a project I will actively maintain. Additionally, the open-source license for this project is "No License," which means I hold full copyright under the framework of agreeing to GitHub's user agreement. If there are restrictions on the dependencies used, will adhere to those. However, this is essentially a very simple script-type code with no significant technical content. If you want to take it, modify it, or patch it up, I have no way to stop you.
